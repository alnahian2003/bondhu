<h1>Bondhu ‚Äî Where Friends Get Connected</h1>
<p>
  Bondhu is a simple social media platform to connect people around the world
  üåé. This is actually a practice project. Main objective of this project is to
  get handy with a MVC framework and learn how to work with it. This knowlege
  will help me later to work with Laravel or any other PHP framework, that
  follows MVC pattern.
